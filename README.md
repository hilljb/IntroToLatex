The not so long short introduction to LaTeX2e

This document is something I created when I was teaching MATH5905 at the University of Colorado
Boulder and introducing first-year graduate students LaTeX. I tried to place a lot of the little
caveats of writing LaTeX into a single document. I hope others find this useful.
